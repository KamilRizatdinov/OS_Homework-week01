Size of page is 8KB.
Size of address is 16 bit.
We need to find the number of entries (number of pages in table)

Lets take a look on that address is:
- First N bits are denoting the page number
- Rest 16-N bits denoting the offset (in our task it is equal to 8KB)

8KB = 8*1024*8 = 2^16 => 
there is only one page in the page table since there is no bits 
in address which stand for the page number

[ANSWER]: Threre is only one entry.
