- Let [Vm] be the virtual address space
- Let [Psz] be the page size (it is equivalent 
for both virtual and physical address space)
- Let [Adrsz] be the address size (it is equivalent 
for both virtual and physical address space)


Number of entries is ([Vm] / [Psz]) * ([Psz] / [Adrsz]) = [Vm] / [Adrsz]
